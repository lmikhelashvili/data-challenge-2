### The number of external texts from each location

For every time block, Wet Land has the most texts made from. 2nd most texts made from Tundra Land 8-17 time blocks; 17-22 Entry Corridor.
```{r}
timeblock_location <- external_fri%>%
  group_by(location, timeblock)%>%
  summarize(
    num = n()
  )%>%
  arrange(desc(num))
```

*What time blocks are the most popular?*
17 is the most populated time block. That is when the shift from Tundra land to Entry Corridor happens. Most of the texts are sent afternoon.

```{r}
external_fri%>%
  group_by(timeblock)%>%
  summarize(num = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(num))
```


Are there repeating numbers that made external calls?



```{r}

  group_by(from,timeblock, location)%>%
  summarize(
    num = n()
  )
 # arrange(from, Timestamp)
```

# Saturday


```{r}
external_sat <- data_Sat%>%
  filter(to == "external" | from == "external")%>%
  mutate(timeblock = hour(Timestamp))
```

### The number of external texts from each location
For most of the time blocks, Wet Land has the most texts made from. At time block 12, it has 838 texts made.


```{r}
timeblock_location_sat <- external_sat%>%
  group_by(location, timeblock)%>%
  summarize(
    num = n()
  )%>%
  arrange(desc(num))
```

*What time blocks are the most popular?*
12 is the most populated time block. 16 is the time when Tundra land, Entry Corridor and Wet Land take turns to  have the most texts. Texts are sent through out the day.

```{r}
external_sat%>%
  group_by(timeblock)%>%
  summarize(num = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(num))
```

Are there repeating numbers that made external calls?

```{r}

  summarize(
    num = n()
  )
 # arrange(from, Timestamp)
```

There were 10 texts sent from the same person, 878 on Saturday. The number of texts were sent evenly to locations: Kiddie Land, Tundra Land, Wet Land.

```

### The number of external texts from each location
Wet Land is the most dominant location which has the most texts. Time block 11 in Wet Land has the most texts sent which was 5364. This is extremely high compared to Friday and Saturday.
```{r}
timeblock_location_sun <- external_sun%>%
  group_by(location, timeblock)%>%

```

*What time blocks are the most popular?*
11am is the most populated time block.

```{r}

Are there repeating numbers that made external calls?
878 and 436 sent the most texts.

Most active people at 11am timeblock sending to **external numbers only**

Top 5 most active id's in timeblock 11am:

```{r}
external_sun%>%
  filter(timeblock == 11)%>%
  group_by(from)%>%
  summarize(num_texts = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(num_texts))%>%
  head(10)
```


All of them are sending texts from 11:45am up to 11:59am. Then they stop sending the texts after 12pm. They have not even sent any texts in 10am timeblock either. This seems very suspicious.

```{r}
id_378256 <- external_sun%>%

total texts made surge at 12pm timeblock

```{r}
total_sun <- data_Sun%>%
  mutate(timeblock = hour(Timestamp))%>%
  group_by(timeblock, location)%>%
  summarize(num_texts_total = n())
```

```{r}

  geom_col(aes(fill = location))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")+
  labs(
    title = "Sunday: total texts (both internal and external) distribution around time"
  )
```

total internal texts made
```{r}
data_Sun%>%
  mutate(timeblock = hour(Timestamp))%>%
  filter(to != "external")%>%
  group_by(timeblock, location)%>%

  )
```

Surge in external calls at 11am -- surge in total texts, mostly internal texts at 12pm. The vandalism happened at 11am and then it was discovered by the visitors at 12pm.
